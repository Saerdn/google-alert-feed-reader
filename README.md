# google-alert-feed-reader
Reads Google Alert feeds and writes it to a database
A (very) simple Google Alert feed reader that let's you collect
information of a Google Alert feed url and writes it into a MySQL table.

Remember to edit the config.php file :)

Start the reader by calling the readGoogleNewsFeed.php file
If you don't need the writing-to-DB-part, just comment it out in the
starter file.
